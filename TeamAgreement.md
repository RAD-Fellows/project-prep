## Team Agreement

### Members: Aaron Clark, Rocio Martinez, Dylan Cooper

## Cooperation Plan

* What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
   * Aaron’s overall strength is in project management, and programming in general. Cooper is strong in doing UI and thinking about the overall user experience.  Rocio's strengths are organization, flexibility, and working collaboratively.
* How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
   * Aaron will act as project coordinator and manage daily tasks and standup + keeping our board up to date and clean.  Cooper will have final say and contribute largely to the finished interface and UX of our app. Rocio will use her collaborative skills to pair program key features in the application and assist with the overall project plan and organization.  Rocio will also contribute the overall design.
* In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
   * Aaron would like to improve his teamwork and collaboration skills. Rocio wants to focus on her collaboration skills and gain experience working with other colleagues. Cooper also wants to improve his collaboration skills and improve on his tool proficiency as it relates to UI/UX.
* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
   * First thing each day will be a daily standup to coordinate what was completed and what we will work on each day. We will plan on being available and generally in Remo during core class hours (9-5).

## Conflict Plan
* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 
   * Discuss any issues individually and directly if possible. If needed, an issue can be escalated to the whole group.  If a decision needs to be made we will have a simple majority vote.
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
   * We will make them work more in pair programming (as a punishment) and make them be the navigator.
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
   * We're all adults. Thus, have some empathy for your teammates who may not be at the same level. We all agree that our main goal is to complete the project, thus working as a unit will be our main goal.
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
   * We would propose each day we’ll review with each other and our project, and have open communication with each other. If one person is behind we can help them reach their goals for each day. Plus, we’ll try to find out if there is a reason for the lack of contributions.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
   * We propose that after attempts to try to resolve the issues ourselves, we would request help from our instructor Rey.

## Communication Plan

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
   * We all agree to work from 9am to 5pm PST.
* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
   * Platforms to communicate is Slack and Remo.
* How often will you take breaks?
   * As many as we need. No set break time.
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
   * We will address concerns at standup and divise a plan to catch up or cut scope.
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
   * There is no expectation for anyone to respond after class hours. We will use slack and people can answer if they are available.
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
   * Allowing everyone to discuss what they are thinking.  Provide everyone with the opportunity and encouragement to speak up.
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
   * We agree that our goal is finishing the project and to work cohesively. We are not expecting perfection, so no negative communication is allowed. We will police each other and make sure that any feedback given is positive.

## Work Plan

* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
   * We will also use Github-projects or trello to help us keep track of any assignments we need to complete.  We will use our daily standup to break out tasks and assign who will be working on what.  We will also have an end of day meeting to sync up on all items that have been completed.
* What project management tool will be used?
   * We will be using GitHuB Projects for project management tool.
Git Process
* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
   * Everything except for environment variables and passwords to databases.
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
   *  The repository will be shared through our organization.
* What is your Git flow?
   * We will have a main branch and a staging branch.  Each team member will do feature task work on their own branch and all pull requeusts will go to staging, not directly to main.
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
   * How many people must review a PR?
      * We will only require one review for a PR into either staging or main.
   * Who merges PRs?
      * Anyone except for the creator of the pull request. (exception for minor change that allows for passing a key piece of work to another team member)
   * How often will you merge?
      * We will merge to main after each major feature is completed.
   * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
      * PR's into staging can be requested for review at any time during the day.  Merges into main will be discussed as a complete group and only for major feature pushes.
